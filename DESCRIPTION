Title: Using Multiple Measurements of Tissue to Estimate Subject- And Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression via Deconvolution
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Jiebiao Wang
Maintainer: Jiebiao Wang <randel.wang@gmail.com>
Description: A method to glean more insights from bulk gene expression. It borrows information across multiple measurements of the same tissue per subject, such as multiple regions of the brain, using an empirical Bayes approach to estimate subject- and cell-type-specific gene expression via deconvolution.
