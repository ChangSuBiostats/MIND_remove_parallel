Title: Using Multiple Measurements of Tissue to Estimate Individual- And Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression via Deconvolution
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jiebiao Wang
Maintainer: Jiebiao Wang <randel.wang@gmail.com>
Description: A method to glean more insights from bulk gene expression. It borrows information across multiple measurements of the same tissue per individual, such as multiple regions of the brain, using an empirical Bayes approach to estimate individual- and cell-type-specific gene expression via deconvolution.
