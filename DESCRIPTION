Title: Using Tissue Expression to Estimate Subject- And Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression via Deconvolution
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Jiebiao Wang
Maintainer: Jiebiao Wang <randel.wang@gmail.com>
Description: Methods to glean more insights from bulk gene expression: MIND and bMIND. MIND borrows information across multiple measurements of the same tissue per subject, such as multiple regions of the brain, using an empirical Bayes approach to estimate subject- and cell-type-specific (CTS) gene expression via deconvolution. The bMIND algorithm provides Bayesian estimates of sample-level CTS expression for each bulk sample.
